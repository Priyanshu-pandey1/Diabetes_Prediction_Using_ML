# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Model

A machine learning project to predict the onset of diabetes using a supervised classification model.

## 🎯 About The Project

This project aims to accurately predict whether a patient is diabetic or not based on several diagnostic features. This model was built using Scikit-learn and common data science libraries. The entire process, from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training and evaluation, is documented in the included Google Colab notebook.
